1).  As an Organizer, I want to know how many current/former Associates live in particular area that have visited the various OW websites -- their main request is they would like more information about OW.  So that I can invite/meet/send/engage or educate them on 1 or  all of the above.

2).  As an Organizer, I want to know how many employees work in the State of Arizona, so that I can Engage, Educate or make them aware of OURWalmart.

3).  As a person that wants to find new ways of showing 'THANKS', I want to see types of tangible gifts that can be delivered to someone's home or office, so that I can place an order via online.

4).  As a person living in another state, I want to know the most efficient way to move my belongings, so that I can take off less time from work.

5).  As a person that loves being involved with Social Justice Issues, I want to know the Clubs/Groups I can visit/join, so that i can become engaged and hopefully find solutions or bring awareness to people of color.

6).  As a Grandmother, I want to know what fun things are available for kids ages 7-16, so that I can take my grandchildren on a mini-vacation.
